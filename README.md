# William He 项目作品集
## Project 1: [基于机器学习模型的成人背景特征进行年薪预测（数据挖掘课程设计）](https://github.com/hexiantao138/Tree-models-to-do-classification-for-adult-dataset)
* 数据集可以在此链接下载: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult
## Project 2: [基于推特内容预测有无种族/性别歧视（文本挖掘课程项目）](https://github.com/hexiantao138/Text-classification-for-twitter)
* Supervised learning of predicting twitter label.
* raw data are both train.csv and test.csv.
* I create a text classification model to predict the label of each twitter in test.csv.
* the label is 0 or 1. 
* 0 means no racist/sexist.
* 1 means racist/sexist.
## Project 3: [基于黑白人体轮廓图像与特征点的互相自动识别 （毕业设计项目）](https://github.com/hexiantao138/Machine-learning-models-for-image-generation-and-key-points-detection)
* The whole project can be split into two parts: keypoints detection and image generation.
* Predicting 18 points in test images and silhouette images in test keypoints.
* Both using machine learning models.
* Even though neural network may get a better effect.
* Classification and regression models must be distinguished in both models.
* Note: The effect highly depends on the training data and test data since their is no outlier in each dataset.
## Project 4: [猫狗图像自动识别（Kaggle竞赛项目）](https://github.com/hexiantao138/Dogs-vs-Cats-Kaggle)
* Create an algorithm to distinguish dogs from cats
* The main purpose of this project can be found in this website link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats
* Training dataset and test dataset can be downloaded in the link
