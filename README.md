# William-He-Project_Portfolio
# Project 1: [Tree-models-to-do-classification-for-adult-dataset](https://github.com/hexiantao138/Tree-models-to-do-classification-for-adult-dataset)
* Dataset can be downloaded here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult
## Data Preprocess: 
* Delete null values 
* remove duplicate values 
* One-hot-encoder to attributes 
* change Salary <=50k to label 0 and >50k to lable 1
## Data Analysis 
* 
## Construct Tree models 
* Use Decision tree and Random forest models to train and predict the label for adult dataset
* The training set and test set both have labels
# Project 2: [Text-classification-for-twitter](https://github.com/hexiantao138/Text-classification-for-twitter)
* Supervised learning of predicting twitter label.
* raw data are both train.csv and test.csv.
* I create a text classification model to predict the label of each twitter in test.csv.
* the label is 0 or 1. 
* 0 means no racist/sexist.
* 1 means racist/sexist.
# Project 3: [Machine-learning-models-for-image-generation-and-key-points-detection](https://github.com/hexiantao138/Machine-learning-models-for-image-generation-and-key-points-detection)
* The whole project can be split into two parts: keypoints detection and image generation.
* Predicting 18 points in test images and silhouette images in test keypoints.
* Both using machine learning models.
* Even though neural network may get a better effect.
* Classification and regression models must be distinguished in both models.
* Note: The effect highly depends on the training data and test data since their is no outlier in each dataset.
# Project 4: [Dogs-vs-Cats-images-classification](https://github.com/hexiantao138/Dogs-vs-Cats-Kaggle)
* Create an algorithm to distinguish dogs from cats
* The main purpose of this project can be found in this website link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats
* Training dataset and test dataset can be downloaded in the link
